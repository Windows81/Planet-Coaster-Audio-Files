# Planet Coaster Audio Files
This repository is supposed to host audio files (in `.ogg`) extracted from Planet Coaster.  Note that not all audio files are yet extracted.

To interact with these files, you can either:
1. Navigate to the page of the audio clip(s) you want to download, access the raw data, and **hit Ctrl+S to save the file**; it wouldn't work otherwise.
2. Go to the *Playlists* folder and download the `.xspf` file you need *(VLC Media Player is required)*.

3. Clone/download this entire repository **(not recommended)**.

## File Tag Names
Each audio package from which the `.ogg` files were extracted from is named is given an `.aux` extension, but is structured as a `.bnk` file.  Below is a list of each of each of the `.aux` archives, and their corresponding locations on the Windows build of the game:

**`audio_music_bnk_s` :** `C:\Program Files\Planet Coaster\Win64\ovldata\Content0\audio_music_bnk_s.aux`
**`audio_coasters_bnk_b` :** `C:\Program Files\Planet Coaster\Win64\ovldata\Content0\audio_coasters_bnk_b.aux`
